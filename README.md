#  Navigation with IMU and Magnetometer

## Overview
This lab focuses on building a navigation stack using GPS and IMU sensors. The objective is to explore the strengths and limitations of these sensors and introduce sensor fusion techniques. The main tasks include:
- Data collection
- Magnetometer calibration
- Yaw estimation
- Forward velocity estimation
- Dead reckoning with the IMU

## Hardware and Software Requirements

### Hardware
- **GNSS Puck**: USB-based GPS sensor
- **VectorNav VN-100 IMU**: USB-based inertial measurement unit

### Software
- **ROS2**: Robot Operating System for sensor integration and data collection
- **GPS Driver**: Obtained from Lab 1
- **IMU Driver**: Obtained from Lab 3
- **MATLAB or Python**: Used for data analysis and visualization

## Data Collection Steps

### 1. Setup and Preparation
- Mount the IMU in the center of the carâ€™s dashboard with the x-axis pointing forward.
- Fix the GPS puck securely on the car roof.
- Connect both sensors to a single laptop for data logging.

### 2. Launch and Verify Sensors
- Create a launch file to start both GPS and IMU driver nodes.
- Verify sensor data publishing using:
  ```bash
  ros2 topic echo /gps
  ros2 topic echo /imu
  ```

### 3. Collect Datasets
- **Car Donuts (Circular Driving):**
  - Start recording a rosbag named `data_going_in_circles`.
  - Drive in circles for 4-5 full loops.
  - Stop recording but keep the sensors running.
- **Mini Boston Tour:**
  - Start recording a rosbag named `data_driving`.
  - Drive around Boston for at least 2-3 kilometers with at least 10 turns.
  - Stop recording once you return to the starting point.

## Data Analysis Steps

### 1. Magnetometer Calibration
- Correct hard-iron and soft-iron effects using circular driving data.
- Plot magnetometer readings before and after calibration to validate improvements.

### 2. Yaw Estimation
- Compute yaw from calibrated magnetometer data.
- Integrate gyroscope data to estimate yaw.
- Implement a complementary filter to combine magnetometer and gyroscope yaw estimates.
- Plot and compare different yaw estimation methods.

### 3. Forward Velocity Estimation
- Integrate forward acceleration from the IMU to estimate velocity.
- Compare this estimation with GPS-derived velocity.
- Adjust acceleration to refine the velocity estimate.

### 4. Dead Reckoning
- Integrate forward velocity to compute displacement.
- Use magnetometer heading to transform velocity into easting and northing components.
- Integrate these components to estimate the full trajectory.
- Compare the IMU-derived trajectory with GPS ground truth data.

## Submitting Lab 4

### Repository Structure
- **`LAB4/`** (Main directory)
  - **`src/`**: Contains driver scripts.
  - **`data/`**: Stores collected rosbag files.
  - **`analysis/`**: Includes data analysis scripts and the final report.

### Submission Instructions
1. Push the repository to GitLab.
2. Upload the final report to Canvas as required.

## Code Execution Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
 git clone <repo_url>
 cd LAB4
```

### 2. Ensure ROS2 is Installed and Sourced
Before running any ROS2 commands, source the ROS2 environment:
```bash
source /opt/ros/<ros_distribution>/setup.bash
```

### 3. Launch GPS and IMU Nodes
Use the provided launch file to start both sensor drivers:
```bash
ros2 launch <your_launch_file>.launch.py
```

### 4. Run Data Analysis
Navigate to the `analysis` directory and execute MATLAB or Python scripts to process the collected data.

## Notes
- Ensure all sensor timestamps use system time.
- Continuously monitor sensors during data collection to prevent data loss.
- Adhere to local traffic laws while collecting data in real-world environments.
